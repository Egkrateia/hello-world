# hello-world
My first GitHub repository

This is my first created repository.  I am currently learning programming and web development by participating in several educational tracts that include: Chingu Cheetahs Cohort, P1xt's Recommended Curriculum for Web Development with Computer Science Foundations, and freeCodeCamp.

Excited about learning programming and the challenging journey ahead.  My goal is to become employable within two years and work remotely where the sun shines and the surf is pumping.
